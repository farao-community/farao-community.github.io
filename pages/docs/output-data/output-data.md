During input data import & RAO computation, CASTOR produces human-readable logs that detail each step of the optimisation. More info on logs [here](rao-logs).  

At the end of the RAO computation, CASTOR produces RAO results detailing the outcome of the optimisation. More info on this [here](rao-result-json).  
These results can be used, along with the [input data](/docs/input-data/), in order to produce context-specific output files. You can find examples of such workflows in one of the many [GridCapa applications](https://github.com/farao-community?q=gridcapa&type=all&language=&sort=).
