Below is the roadmap of future major releases of FARAO, with the associated functional perimeter,
and a foreseen due date. It is important to understand that these due dates may be subject to
change due to unforeseen complexity in implementing features or priority changes. 

### Readiness of CASTOR for Italy North Capacity Calculation (Summer 2021)

- Modify voltage level topology as a remedial action
- Handle HVDC setpoint as a remedial action

### Readiness of CASTOR for local CEP Validation for Italy North (May 2021)

### Curative optimization in CASTOR: v*2.3.0* (February 2021)

- Optimization of **curative** PST and topological remedial actions

### Enhancement of CASTOR to fit additional CORE j-2 CC needs (October 2020)

- One additional **objective function** : maximization of the min. relative margin 
- Consideration of the MNEC **Monitored Network Elements** in the RAO
- Additional input used for the loop-flow calculation : the **reference program** file

### First operational release of CASTOR: v*2.2.0* (July 2020)

- Optimization of **preventive** PST and **topological** remedial actions
- **Two possible objective functions** : min. margin positive or min. margin maximized
- Branch monitored in one or both directions, with **thresholds defined in MW, I or %Imax**
- Branch monitored in **N and N-1 states**
- **AC and DC computations** (for load flow and sensitivity analyses)
- Limitation of **loopflows** in the RAO, as described in the ACER methodology

### Partial release of CASTOR: v*2.0.0* (March 2020)

- Optimization of **preventive** PST and **topological** remedial actions
- **Objective function** : min. margin positive
- Branch monitored in both directions, with **thresholds defined in MW**
- Branch monitored in **N and N-1 states**
- **AC computations** (for load flow and sensitivity analyses)
