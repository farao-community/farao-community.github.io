FARAO is an open source project aiming at providing an efficient solution for electrical power systems'
Coordinated Capacity Calculation and Coordinated Security Assessment.

In 2020 [Annual Work Programme](https://consultations.entsoe.eu/entso-e-general/have-your-say-on-entso-es-annual-work-programme-20/supporting_documents/191017_ENTSOE%20AWP%202020_Stakeholder%20consultation.pdf),
ENTSO-E states that:

> The future of regional TSO coordination and focus of the RCCs in the next years will be strongly driven by
> the integration of costly remedial actions in complex capacity calculation methodologies [...]

and that:

> Transparency and timely implementation of the [...] Network Codes are seen as paramount for
> achieving the optimal integration of the European market.

By providing open source solutions for remedial actions coordination, FARAO tools aim at improving electrical system
social welfare and facilitating renewable energies integration while ensuring security of supply and optimal operations
of the electrical power network.
