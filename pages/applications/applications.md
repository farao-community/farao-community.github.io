Many operational applications involve optimising remedial actions for critical network elements; and these applications often need to achieve different goals.
The FARAO Toolbox can be used in a variety of cases thanks to the large scope of features it covers; its behaviour can be tuned using [configuration parameters](/docs/parameters).

You can find in these pages small examples of usages for FARAO.
