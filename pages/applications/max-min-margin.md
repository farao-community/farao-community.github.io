## CASTOR - maximization of the minimum margin

#### Example of use cases : 

Flow based CORE Capacity Calculation operated by RCC


Based on a simulated Market Clearing point resulting for net positions forecast, CASTOR will 
maximize the available margin on all CNECs while limiting the loop-flows – all critical outages will be simulated and 
solved to ensure grid security.

Where no positive available margin can be ensured the set of available remedial actions, CASTOR will reduce as much as 
possible the negative margin on CNEC.
