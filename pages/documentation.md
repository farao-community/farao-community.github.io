## What is FARAO

FARAO stands for "*Fully Autonomous Remedial Actions Optimisation*". It is an open-source
toolbox that aims at providing a modular engine for remedial actions optimisation.

FARAO is a [PowSyBl](http://www.powsybl.org) based toolbox that provides software
solutions for power systems coordinated capacity calculation and security analysis projects.
It is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/farao-community) under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

## Functional overview

[FARAO toolbox](https://github.com/farao-community/farao-core) functional perimeter is declined following three main development axis:

- [Business data](/docs/data) modelisation - providing a java modelisation of all the business objects
for power systems coordinated capacity calculation and security analysis projects.
- [Computation engines](/docs/engine) - providing open interface and efficient implementation of standard
tools for supporting capacity calculation projects.
- [Exchange standards](/docs/format) interface - providing importers and exporters to support ENTSOE exchange
data interface in projects implementation.    

By extending the [PowSyBl](http://www.powsybl.org) framework, FARAO aims at providing an open, transparent,
and extandable implementation of the tools used for an efficient usage of the electricity transport
and distribution system.
