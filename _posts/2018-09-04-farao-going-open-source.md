FARAO toolbox goes a step towards open-source distribution...
<!--more-->

[FARAO community](http://github.com/farao-community) space on GitHub has been created, and the team is currently working at the code base migration. The first release is coming soon.

Checking that no private information is left in the code, that there is no license incompatibility in the code base, that the code is understandable and documented enough...
That is an important work, that gives us the opportunity to look back on those few months of development and make sure the team provides high quality inputs to the community!

We are really looking forward to share the results of this work with the community - at least the part that has not yet been shared via our participation in [powsybl](http://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-core/) framework!
