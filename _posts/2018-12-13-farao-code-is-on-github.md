Here we are, FARAO code base has been open-sourced on GitHub this day. It's been a long journey, but it is only the first
step of a more exciting year to come... 
<!--more-->

Current FARAO code is just the base on which our future tools will be built. We want FARAO community to
be part of these tools design and/or improvements. That is main reason why we decided to publish FARAO
on an open platform such as GitHub.

Current code base is divided into two repositories:
- **[farao-core](http://github.com/farao-community/farao-core)** which contains the core features of FARAO:
CRAC model and import functions, remedial actions optimisation interface and prototype, ...
- **[farao-gse](http://github.com/farao-community/farao-gse)** which contains the demonstration interface
for FARAO features. It will be the base for future results demonstration.
 
[FARAO community](http://github.com/farao-community) website has also been enriched with a [documentation space](https://farao-community.github.io/docs)
space, which is a good source of information about FARAO project. A [high level roadmap](https://farao-community.github.io/roadmap) has also been added.

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/farao-community/farao-core/issues).

See you soon on GitHub !
